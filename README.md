This project focuses on the design and implementation of a color sorting pick-and-place robotic arm, developed as a group graduation project at Çukurova University.
Using an Arduino Uno, the system detects objects based on their color and autonomously performs pick-and-place operations through coordinated motor control.

The project integrates Arduino programming, sensor-based decision making, and basic robotic control principles to demonstrate an end-to-end automation task.
It highlights practical experience in embedded systems, robotic manipulation, and engineering-oriented system integration.
